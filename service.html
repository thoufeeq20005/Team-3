            <h2>Content Creator</h2>
            <p>A content creator is someone who creates entertaining or educational material to be expressed through any medium or channel.

                Content creation especially pertains to digital content, since that’s where the majority of content is consumed — and where the money is, if you’re looking to earn revenue through your efforts.</p>

            <h2>Social Media Marketer</h2>
            <p>Social media marketers are specialists who use social media platforms to promote a company’s offerings. They often use platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok to reach new customers, engage with current ones, and announce new products or services.

                The role affords much in the way of flexibility. Social media marketers can work in-house in a dedicated role within a company or work as freelancers hired to work for an hourly rate.</p>
